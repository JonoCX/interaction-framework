Their model is a form of graph neural network that learns user representations from the spatio-temporal behaviour data. The evaluation is focused on the performance of the model compare to others. The authors consistently use 'behaviour' throughout, and associate it with anything that includes the users interactions, but their definition is unclear - do they mean the patterns of interactions, the location, time, and items that users interacted with?","Their data includes user sessions, their locations, and items that they've clicked on.","Their data is represented as a graph - with items and locations connected to sessions. An edge appears when the user has interacted with an item in a session and a location ↔  session edge appears when they've visited a particular location. Their model utilises this information through embeddings and a graph cnn. Their models are trained to predict the age, income, and gender of users.","Their usage of the term behaviours appears to be associating it with anything that contains the interactions of users with items. It's not clear what the authors mean by behaviours - they could just refer to the interactions with items as interactions. There is a stronger case here for the authors using the term behaviours, as it includes additional contextual information - their location and time - but it's weak.

Practical Data Poisoning Attack against Next-Item Recommendation,"Zhang, Hengtong; Li, Yaliang; Ding, Bolin; Gao, Jing",Yes,No,2,"new modelling approach (with interaction data), tighten language","This paper proposes a new type of poisoning attack against blackbox recommendation models, specifically models that are trained to predict the next item the user will 'choose'.

Anxiety and Information Seeking: Evidence From Large-Scale Mouse Tracking,"Youngmann, Brit; Yom-Tov, Elad",Yes,Yes,4,understanding the user,"The paper investigates the behaviour of people - through their cusor movements - during searches for medical symptoms. They are interested in understanding how people's interaction with search engines changes when they experiencing anxiety due to the nature of the information they are seeking. They use cursor data, collected from Bing, and extract metrics - from these metrics, they infer behaviours.",Queries and interaction data (cursor movements) are collected from Bing - the authors only collected data for queries that matched medical symptoms of interest.,"From the cursor movements, they extracted and engineered a range of metrics to quantify the amount of user interaction with the SERP and the extent of the SERP with which the user has interacted. Such as, the number of times the user has scrolled up.","To uncover behaviours, the authors train a ranker to predict the anxiety level from the interaction metrics. The authors focus on two metrics in their evaluation of behaviours and to demonstrate associations between behaviour and anxiety: the portion of the screen the user interacted with and the deepest click results. They find that lower ranked queries (those where the anxiety is higher) the users focuses on a smaller portion of the result page and tend to click on higher ranked results. They also find that queries for severe symptoms are very similar in behaviour to navigational queries, whereas queries for benign symptoms are more similar to informational queries.","The paper is interested in understanding how user interactions change when users experience anxiety - with anxiety being the phenomena that they are interested in. To quantify the anxiety, they do not ask the users directly, but rather, get medical professionals to rank the severity of the symptoms described by the users in their queries and then compare the correlation between the rankings and lay-peoples ranking of anxiety if they were experiencing the symptoms - they find that they're highly correlated.","The authors do not validate their work by asking the users or by performing a user study. Instead, they test their model in three special cases (where medical intervention could be need) and evaluate the behaviour of users. They demonstrate that search engines may need to take into account the behaviour of users depending on the type of query issued.","The paper doesn't validate their model with a user study, but it does demonstrate layers of the taxonomy.

Their goal is to infer intent from users via a novel model architecture.,"The work is projected into this dimension of the taxonomy through their language and approach. Their work is motivated by being able to differentiate between a user in 'discovery' mood and 'purchase' mood and how they capture this user intent in their model architecture - it's an example of their hypothesis sitting in the layer above where it should be. However, the actual intent of users isn't captured or validated - they don't know that the user is in a 'discovery' mood. Their latent intent is learnt from past items and user interactions.

Item Recommendation on Monotonic Behavior Chains,"Wan, Mengting; McAuley, Julian",Yes,No,5,"new modelling approach (with interaction data), tighten language","This paper presents a method of representation user-item interactions as chains and a new modelling technique to make recommendations. Interactions are encoded as binary vectors, i.e. if the user clicked, purchases, reviewed, but did not recommend, then the vector would be [1, 1, 1, 0]. Over the course of a session, the user builds up chains of these vectors, and the authors use them to perform item recommendation. The paper mixes language, referring to the actions as actions and interaction stages. Their paper proposes methods that can model the users intentions and preferences, but there is no validation on whether this is the case beyond evaluating the performance. The authors do not further claim that their model can capture underlying user intent based on it's performance, but rather when the model is proposed.","One of the main contributions of the paper is the data - both in the open-sourcing of a benchmarking dataset and the data representation. Their data takes the form of binary chains (behaviour chains) where if the user performs a click, purchase, review, and no recommend then the chain would be [1, 1, 1, 0]. The 'interaction stages' are dependent on the prior being performed, i.e., no recommend with a review, etc.",They propose a model that works with this type of data.,"The authors state that their model can model the users intention and intrinsic behaviour intentions - this is not validated or explored.

The authors use the historical interactions of users to create a model that can predict the next item to be consumed by each user and generate recommendation lists. The authors state that their model aims to capture the users inherent intent and long-term preferences, but this is not tested for or evaluated against in their experiments - their data contains no proxy or ground truth for intent.

The paper focuses on proposing and evaluating their approach compared to the state of the art. Throughout the paper, the authors hypothesise about user behaviours and their use of language is inconsistent.","The input to their model are sequences of user actions. There are two types: target and auxiliary. Target are the set of actions that the model aims to predict while the auxiliary sequences act similar to context. In their experiments, they use two datasets. Their first is a e-commerce dataset, with 'purchase' acting as the target sequences and 'clicking' as the auxiliary. In their second, from WeChat, 'sharing' is the target while 'clicking' the auxiliary.","Their model is a graph-based neural network which uses the target sequences, auxiliary, and item representation to predict items that maximise a particular target action.","Throughout the paper, the authors hypothesise about higher-level user behaviours and it is suggested that their modelling approach captures these.

RLPer: A Reinforcement Learning Model for Personalized Search,,Yes,No,44,"new modelling approach (with interaction data), tighten language","The paper proposes a new reinforcement model for personalised search. Their motivation to develop the model is that user interest changes over time - over the course of a search session - and the model should account for that by re-ranking the results according to the users current inferred interest. Interest is measured by whether or not a user clicks on a search result - this is used as the reward. The authors compare their model to other state-of-the-art approaches, finding that it outperforms them. There is a mixing of terminology throughout the paper, with clicks on search results referred to as a behaviours. The authors also posit their findings into a higher level of the framework by stating that an increase in performs means that the model is capturing a user behaviour without performing validation - there is also an example of an increase in performance for a particular model meaning that a specific behaviour (re-finding) is performed by users.","Historical clicks during search sessions. The data used in experiments is an AOL dataset which includes the search query, query issued time, clicked url, and the ranking of the url in the search result.","There is some preprocessing on the data, mostly to remove outliers and to produce a usable representation of the queries. Their model would sit here. It's a reinforcement learning model where the search engine is the agent, the user is the environment, and the session is an episode. Their models aims to optimise the probability of a user clicking on a document based on their historical interactions.","The authors frame the clicks on search results as behaviours (click behaviours) in the paper. They state that their model can capture user interests better mostly based on it's increase in performance over the other models, but this isn't validated beyond testing the effect of model components. The model is designed to capture user interests, which are inferred based on the results they click on, but it isn't tested against a ground truth (or proxy of ground truth).","User Interest - their model is designed to produce search results that are tailored to the individual, thus better meeting their search query (intent).","Validation is focused on how the model performs in certain settings and which components of the model contribute the most to the personalisation task.

Personalized Image Retrieval with Sparse Graph Representation Learning,,Yes,No,43,"new modelling approach (with interaction data), tighten language","The paper presents a method for learning user and image embeddings within an image search context - the approach uses user-image interactions to enrich both user and image embeddings in a graph convolutional network. The authors use the past interactions of users on the Adobe Stock platform (a place to search for stock images) to personalise the search results. Their approach creates enriched embeddings of users, images, and user-specific queries to match images to users. Their experiments on the proposed model focus on its performance, but there is some evaluation on the recommendations produced and why a user may have not clicked on the images. The authors refer to clicks as user behaviours throughout.","Their data is captured from the Adobe Stock platform. It takes the form of tuples containing: user, their query, and the image they clicked on. Evaluation is performed on two datasets, one a daily and the other monthly, to compare the model performance.","There is little processing performed on the data itself, but the is a strong focus on the construction of enriched embeddings. The user-image interactions are transformed into a graph and processed by the model to create their embeddings, along with images and queries, which are then used to match users to images based on their queries.","The clicks that users perform are referred to as click behaviours.

Predicting Dynamic Embedding Trajectory in Temporal Interaction Networks,,Yes,No,,"new modelling approach (with interaction data), tighten language","The paper proposes a new feature representation method where users and items are embedded based on the users temporal interactions - e.g., as the user interacts overtime, their embedding changes to represent a change in the user. Time is incorporated into the model to produce the embeddings. The authors test their feature representation method in several experiments, with the main two focusing on predicting the next interaction and predicting a change in the state of users (drop out). The authors focus on the performance of the models in these settings, and do not discuss the actions or behaviours of the users. There is one instance of using 'behaviour' when taking about the interactions of users. Their data focuses on high level actions performed by users, i.e., listening to a song or posting on reddit.

","Metrics are monitored in real-time, for example, the distance to the bottom of the page, the reading ratio, and current scroll location.

They design algorithms detecting for quick review, asking for help, retracing or circling, and quick revisitation.

Ground truth data is captured in a study and the participants take part in various types of chats to encourage particular feelings. The authors extract multiple heatmaps (down-down, up-down, and pressure metrics) from their data and train a variational autoencoder to learn low-level feature embeddings of the heatmaps. A fully-connected feedforward network is then trained to perform the classification. They find that they can accurately predict the states.",Raw keyboard interactions were captured on a mobile device while participants in a study were conversing across multiple chats.,"Metrics are extracted from the interactions: down-down speed (typing speed; time between two touch down events), up-down speed (speed between touch events; time between a touch up and subsequent touch down), and pressure.

The authors then train a model to predict their outcome - it consists of a variational autoencoder and a fully connected feedforward network.",The authors only briefly touch up on behaviours of users - their focus is the modelling - by saying that the use of more backspaces is present when experiencing negative emotions but conclude that using the modelling with spatial heat maps only (that would capture this) has little predictive power.,"Their outcome of interest is the affective states of the users, i.e., does the emotion of the users translate into their keyboard interactions depending on the type of conversation they are currently having.
