# Chaos in the Clicks: Towards a Framework for the Analysis of Interaction Data

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/450113721.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/450113721)

Through an analysis of the relevant literature, we found that the processes used and decisions made when handling interaction data (the clicks, cursor movements, etc., of users) were unclear and the use of terminology - what constitutes a behaviour, for example - is inconsistent across the literature. These issues introduce a communication barrier between stakeholders: researchers (those carrying out the analysis) and consumers (those wanting to reproduce, apply, or review the work), which reduces transparency and hinder reproducibility. 

As such, we propose a methodological framework which can be used by stakeholders when using interaction data to understand user behaviours, enabling clear communication.

Contained within this repository is the data - the analysed literature - that was collected as part of the fresh analysis. Here is a brief description of each data file:

* `framwork_data_all.csv` contains all of the sampled papers from the analysis.

**This is an active repository, with data and analysis being added over time. Please consult the releases for particular snapshots of the data.**
